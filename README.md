project p1 title - Rev Anaysis on Credit card


 In this project we are working on a customer credit card dataset  by
using Apache Spark, which is a data processing framework that can quickly perform processing tasks on very large data
sets, and can also distribute data processing tasks across multiple computers, either on its own or in tandem with other
distributed computing tools. Using these datasets and Spark SQL we have created various use cases pertaining to real life scenarios in banking.
